# release-bundle v6.0.3

`release-bundle` is the packaging module for producing the browser-distributed `dist/qhtml.js` artifact.

## What's New in v6.0.3

- Bundle now ships the updated runtime behavior for safer `q-bind`, queued host ready dispatch, and source-preserving mount parsing.
- Build output remains a single ordered artifact for browser use: `dist/qhtml.js`.

## What this module actually does

- Defines strict module concatenation order so global module dependencies attach correctly:
  1. `qdom-core`
  2. `qhtml-parser`
  3. `dom-renderer`
  4. `qhtml-runtime`
  5. `src/root-integration.js`
- Verifies required source files exist before building.
- Writes a generated header with UTC timestamp.
- Produces a single bundle file at `dist/qhtml.js`.
- Refreshes `dist/w3.qhtml` from `dist/w3.css` when Node is available, using `tools/w3-css-to-qhtml.js`.
- Bundle includes language/runtime features added in source modules (for example `q-property`, `q-bind`, `.qdom().rewrite(...)`, and `<q-html>.update()` support).

## Why this module matters

- Runtime modules are loaded as IIFE globals, so ordering is required.
- Central build script keeps distribution predictable and reproducible.

## Usage example

```bash
bash src/build-release.sh
```

**Output result**

```text
Wrote /workspace/qhtml6/dist/qhtml.js
```
